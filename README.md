# ServerControl

## Introduction

An updated version of the previously submitted server-control demo app. The current version now includes angular material components. The control panel is displayed using Material Expansion Panel, inside an accordion element. This allows for numerous dynamically rendered elements to occupy the viewport.

## Installation

Have [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) installed globally. All the dependencies used for this application are managed by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies. Run `ng serve` to start the application. Open the browser, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
